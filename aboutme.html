      Hi I am Rishabh Aggarwal. I live in the United States. I am 14 years old and am in 9th Grade.
      In 9th Grade my favorite subject is math because it challenges me to use my brain.
      I love to code because I find it unquie an intresting. I dislike reading and writing because when I start to read I fall asleep.
      I do alot of extra-cirricular activities like Destination Imagination and Boyscouts. I won 2nd place
      in the world for my DI competition. In Boyscouts I am currently Star rank which is 2 away from the prestigous
      rank of eagle.This is just some stuff about me
